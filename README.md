# BallRace

BallRace is a prototyme of a simple application (2D game) made with Unity engine and C# language, in which balls race to the finish line.
The application's uses can be all sorts. For example, it can be a replacement for the well-known "rock-paper-scissors" to determine the order of people. It can also be used as a wheel of fortune to select one of the given options, or even to predict the winner of a match.
